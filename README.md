## Set-up Process

We are using the [yarn package manager](https://yarnpkg.com/) to manage our dependencies. Assuming that ``yarn`` is installed properly and the user is in the base directory, the following commands can be used to install all the packages:
```
yarn install:all
```
This should run a script that installs all dependencies required by the base, client, and server. Once all dependencies have been installed, the following command should call a script to run the client and server:
```
yarn start
```
